Master Fix Prompt: Full Integration + UI/UX Overhaul + AI Repair
1. 🚀 Upgrade Nav Bar to 2025 UX/UI Standards
🔧 Tasks:

Redesign nav bar with 2025 UX trends:

Sticky nav with scroll shrink behavior

Smooth hover transitions, dropdowns (for pricing, features, resources)

Mobile menu with animated hamburger and overlay background

Integrated profile dropdown (if logged in) with avatar, settings, logout

Add active route highlighting

Use glassmorphism / gradient / dark-light toggle if consistent with brand

✅ Outcome:

Modern, fluid, responsive nav bar with clear call-to-actions, animations, and full route integration.

2. 🌀 App Load Experience Overhaul
🔧 Tasks:

Add loading transitions between screens (fade-in/fade-out or loader overlay)

Add initial app load animation (branding logo pulse or slide-in)

Use skeleton loading states where data is fetched (e.g. post builder, dashboard)

Implement route transitions using Framer Motion or similar animation libs

✅ Outcome:

App feels premium from first load, with smooth transitions and responsive feedback

3. 🤖 Fix AI Story Generator (Connect AI Endpoint)
🔧 Tasks:

Locate AI endpoint for story generation (check env vars like AI_STORY_API_URL)

Integrate it in the individual content builder:

On “Generate Story” or similar action, call AI endpoint with user prompt

Show loader while generating

On success, inject content into story field

On error, display toast or alert with failure message

Add retry mechanism (if server is down or slow)

✅ Outcome:

AI story/caption generation works live inside the builder with connected backend

4. 🧩 Fix Individual Content Builder (Ensure Full Integration)
🔧 Tasks:

Check if individual content builder has these issues:

🔌 Missing binding to backend (Supabase or local state)

🧠 No AI content generation

🎯 Broken preview/render logic

💾 Missing “Save”, “Publish”, or “Schedule” triggers

Fix builder to include:

✅ Platform selector

✅ Text inputs (caption, hashtags, etc.)

✅ Media upload (with Supabase Storage)

✅ AI generation integration

✅ Post preview

✅ Schedule & publish

Confirm every field updates post object correctly and syncs to Supabase

✅ Outcome:

The builder becomes fully functional and reliable with end-to-end post creation and AI story generation

5. 🔌 Ensure Full Backend Integration (Supabase + APIs)
🔧 Tasks:

Confirm:

🟢 All forms and builders send data to Supabase via insert or update

🟢 AI endpoint is correctly called and response is used

🟢 Media files are uploaded and stored in Supabase Storage

🟢 User data is authenticated via Supabase Auth

Test connections to:

TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, etc. (dummy or live APIs)

Stripe or payment provider

Add Supabase logging (optional): log AI usage, post creation, media upload events

✅ Outcome:

App is tightly integrated — all features talk to backend and respond as expected

6. 📲 Final UI Polish Pass (Across All Screens)
🔧 Tasks:

Apply consistent UI styles:

Button styles (primary, secondary, disabled)

Input styling (focus, error states)

Card components for posts

Modal styling with transitions

Match 2025 design trends:

Minimalist with depth

Microinteractions (button press, field focus)

Fluid animations on hover/click

Elevated UX on mobile (bigger hit zones, clean nav)
